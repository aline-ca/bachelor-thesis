<line> once we jumped from our jungle location, </line>
<line> walked as bipeds in hunters' formation, </line>
<line> learned to kill and to cook? </line>
<line> but the closer we look, </line>
<line> there's no progress in civilization. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> claims adjusters, insurance-type guys, </line>
<line> are so easy to hate and despise. </line>
<line> it seems like they aim </line>
<line> to deny every claim. </line>
<line> do those "good hands" hold nothing but lies? </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> the new gal on the staff? holy moly! </line>
<line> her computer moves info so slowly. </line>
<line> if i speed up her data rate, </line>
<line> do you think i would rate a date? </line>
<line> i'm lovesick and long for her solely. </line>

<poem>
<line> the change in your vision's dramatic </line>
<line> when your cornea's curve is erratic. </line>
<line> in the image transferred, </line>
<line> part is sharp, part is blurred, </line>
<line> once your vision's become astigmatic. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> if my hon and i don't have a gun </line>
<line> and a bear has us both on the run, </line>
<line> my survival technique </line>
<line> isn't fancy; i'll seek </line>
<line> to outrun not the bear, but my hon. </line>

<poem>
<line> dactylology's used by the deaf. </line>
<line> (finger spelling, that's d-e-a-f.) </line>
<line> by the way, if the mood </line>
<line> strikes for great finger food, </line>
<line> go to rollie's? thumbs up to their chef. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> dropping coins in the box, people say, </line>
<line> "when that violin's played, we will pay." </line>
<line> but while faces were turned, </line>
<line> someone stole what was earned, </line>
<line> so the fiddler was fiddled that day. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> i think that it's blatantly clear </line>
<line> that my firm's had a bad fiscal year. </line>
<line> i wanted a raise, </line>
<line> but instead, i got praise </line>
<line> and a title change: chief volunteer! </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> for dinner i'll tell you my wish: </line>
<line> it's risotto, my favorite dish. </line>
<line>   take some veggies, add rice, </line>
<line>   mix with chicken and spice, </line>
<line> but omit the accessory fish. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> as a tourist in rome, i whined, "jeez! </line>
<line> these pizzas ain't got any cheese!" </line>
<line> the chef winked, "i gotcha! </line>
<line> not pizza? focaccia!" </line>
<line> new jersey does better than these! </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> absolutely convinced that you know </line>
<line> something's right, having checked like a pro </line>
<line> that it's certainly true, </line>
<line> and a certainty too? </line>
<line> it would seem undeniably so. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> the red on the barber's white pole </line>
<line> that sits on a blood-letting bowl: </line>
<line> is he feeding his leeches </line>
<line> on clients, while each is </line>
<line> re-trimmed? their original goal? </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> biogenous matter, like ooze, </line>
<line> is created when animals lose </line>
<line> their lives and decay </line>
<line> after falling away </line>
<line> to the bottoms of lakes, where they snooze. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> as a gard'ner my fingers be green, </line>
<line> an' that book-larnin's just not my scene. </line>
<line> this contraption of babbage's </line>
<line> counts up my cabbages? </line>
<line> 'tis a fine calculating machine. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> my grandma espouses donations </line>
<line> to a few "save the wombat" foundations. </line>
<line> but her fundraising trails </line>
<line> what's collected for whales; </line>
<line> seems cetaceans rule public relations. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> "cyclone fencing? that's money well spent!" </line>
<line> but i'd misunderstood what he meant. </line>
<line> it's the same as, i think, </line>
<line> any fence of chain link. </line>
<line> it is not an olympic event. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> an elderly pair lay in bed. </line>
<line> as they woke, "do not touch me," she said, </line>
<line> "for i'm acheless!  abstain! </line>
<line> nothing hurts, there's no pain, </line>
<line> which most certainly means that i'm dead." </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> the cubitus goes from man's hand </line>
<line> to his elbow; a cubit is spanned. </line>
<line> man, for ages, would treasure </line>
<line> this measure with pleasure. </line>
<line> i ask, "ain't anatomy grand?" </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> now that purges don't take up their time, </line>
<line> the reformers are turning to crime. </line>
<line> so the people are storming </line>

<line> restoring a peaceable clime. </line>

<poem>
<line> my uncle's a terrible boaster. </line>
<line> he claims he invented the toaster! </line>
<line> i've heard him take credit </line>
<line> for hamlet (you've read it?). </line>
<line> his bragging could fill up a poster. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> "to make greater in size or extent"? </line>
<line> that is just what it means to augment. </line>
<line> but as some things expand, </line>
<line> they get way out of hand. </line>
<line> that's why lies seldom end as you meant. </line>
</poem>
<poem>

<line> well, my father finds water. he'll dowse. </line>
<line> "please pronounce the word dowz," </line>

</poem>
<poem>
<line> of adactylia one might suppose </line>
<line> there's no benefit anyone knows. </line>

<line> you're never caught picking your nose. </line>

<line> had harvested grapes to make vino. </line>
<line> but he just couldn't wait </line>
<line> for the wine to taste great, </line>
<line> so it's grapejuice he shipped off to reno. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> unlike wrestling, pro boxing's no act. </line>
<line> heads were broken last night, that's a fact! </line>
<line> but by this i just mean </line>
<line> cuts and bruises were seen. </line>
<line> no one's skull had been actually cracked. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> a decay constant sets the delay </line>
<line> when physical "things" go away. </line>
<line> the remainder will  be </line>
<line> a pure function of e, </line>
<line> to the negative t times the k. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> when a box warns you "handle with care", </line>
<line> fragile stuff is inside, so beware. </line>
<line> you had better take heed </line>
<line> and with caution proceed, </line>
<line> or the contents you'll have to repair. </line>

<line> (leaving scales as they are, if you wish), </line>

<line> and poach it, which oughta </line>
<line> make fish cooked au bleu as your dish. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> the transitive verb to adduce </line>
<line> has a really tight meaning (not loose). </line>
<line> use "discern" or "determine," </line>
<line> you show lack of learnin'; </line>
<line> adduce? "give as reasons or proofs." </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> shepherd tom's favorite buck had dropped dead, </line>
<line> so he took several ewes to his bed. </line>
<line> in a voice a bit unctious, </line>
<line> tom said, "i'm rambunctious, </line>
<line> and the woolite has gone to my head." </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> i tie cord to a carved slat of wood </line>
<line> and then whirl it as fast as one could. </line>
<line> when my bullroarer roars, </line>
<line> all my friends stay indoors </line>
<line> for my knot-tying skill isn't good. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> though he likes me, this guy won't declare it. </line>
<line> so for now, i just grin and i bear it. </line>
<line> if he ever comes courtin', </line>
<line> you'll find me reportin' </line>
<line> to all. (if the woo fits, you share it.) </line>

<line> sitting idly, just going to seed, </line>
<line> that flaneur's not at all what we need. </line>
<line> are his circuits all tired? </line>
<line> someone get him rewired! </line>
<line> pass the pasta; the bum's off his feed. </line>

<poem>
<line> prithee, dread not the cold, here's a coat </line>
<line> made of dreadnought, it snaps at your throat. </line>

<line> the cruciferous vegetables mingle </line>
<line> a sulfurous tongue-teasing tingle </line>
<line> in collards, kohlrabi, </line>
<line> kale, turnips, wasabi, </line>
<line> a nutrient-fiber-filled jingle. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> the plague, or black death, was bubonic </line>
<line> though some think 'twas also pneumonic. </line>
<line> rude carts choked the streets, </line>
<line> filled with dead wrapped in sheets, </line>
<line> for they lacked penicillin as tonic. </line>
</poem>
<poem>
<line> as a breather, you'd better install </line>
<line> a breather (a vent) in this wall; </line>
<line> if not, you should either </line>
<line> go out for a breather, </line>
<line> or else do no breathing at all. </line>

</poem>
<poem>
<line> if you live in the water while young </line>

<line> you're amphibiotic, </line>
<line> which ain't idiotic, </line>
<line> at least if it's frogs you're among. </line>
