we're expected to lie
to protect our big chief's reputation.

the coiffure he so boyishly styled
was a look that drove womenfolk wild.
this impression would vanish,
for his come-on was mannish.
their reaction? the women just smiled.

"my support for this bill i profess."
is he voting his conscience?  i guess,
but the timing seems strange
for his compass to change?
what was wrong now is right; he'll vote yes.

defined benefit plans fix your pension:
you can plan your world cruise without tension.
if investments don't pay
the providers, then they
could go bust, which the leaflets don't mention.

public servants all know, if they're hip,
post-retirement, you may double-dip
if your work's deemed essential.
the drill is (sequential):
retire; get rehired. it's a rip!

the slim figure is strange, and i guess
that she might  have a bomb in her dress.
she gives me a frown
as i'm patting her  down.
is this woman displosive? oh, yes!

yerevan? i was there with friend luke
when he bought their famed pipe, a duduk.
he got drunk, played it (sadly)
annoyingly badly;
the natives said, "damn guy's a kook!"

i've  a suit made entirely of maille
from the coif to the chausses, top to tail.
not chain mail (there's no stamp!):
i'm the tournament champ,
as i battle with axe, sword and flail.

to be far in the future. seduced
by the amortisation,
your organisation
has pigeons returning to roost.

i'm a bastard named limeraiku.
my dad's say: "prose ok."?what to do

as she hurdled each pew to his side:
her tracksuit looked weird?
as did her false beard:
"wedding's off!" he immediately cried.

i expect it is one of his dim bids.
he isn't a florist,
but lives in the forest
and won't pay the price for my cymbids.

licensed pharmacists ably dispense
most prescribed medications and hence,
lest some dose go awry,
make their clients supply
doctor's orders that clearly make sense.

i'm "attending" a cyber school now
(99% "passes", they vow!).
my work gets assessed
by an email-sent test.
wish me luck, 'cause i need it somehow!

when a twelve-sided figure draws mention,
the dodecagon gets the attention.
but a dodecahedron,
as all have agreed on,
has an eminent extra dimension!

body-surfing's a cheap thrill at hand
at the ocean. ride waves. understand?
stretch and stiffen your torso
like a surfboard, but moreso.
you'll end up with a suit full of sand.

discontentedness needs to be curbed;
you're unhappy, disgruntled, perturbed.
let's rejoice and be gay?
blow those cobwebs away!
i hate seeing you sad and disturbed.

shut up, i say! silence now! clum!
don't utter a word! just stay mum!
and stop waving your hand:
others may understand
what you say, if like you, they are dumb.

"what's the difference," asked my friend gene,
"in the tasks and the duties, between
the caregivers'  jobs

by our own major dunn?

though the army came up with new tricks.

vivisectionists try to sound breezy
when they say callisection is easy.
that's the kind where they use
anesthetics.  they choose
to or not.  just the thought makes me queasy.

giving birth in a county that's rural,
i'm afraid i won't have epidural
anesthesia. it's plain
i'm concerned about pain?
i've got twins, so the birth will be plural.

her beauty and breeding could ravish.
he was caught in her spell,

this use of the word may seem strange,

yes, that's one range, not two?

it misleads, and your thoughts need to change.

on the first day of may 'mongst the gaels,
a great burst of wild play still prevails.
at these bealtaine feasts,
cowherds once led their beasts
through spent fires? by their heads, not their tails.

i didn't feel right in the head,
so i took to a hospital bed
where i slept over days
in a sedative haze;

what? you think there's a catch?
oh, how much did you say that you weigh?

an atheist honors no god.
some people would call one a clod,

"who made god, then?" no answer? how odd.?.?.?.

n objects are ordered, and you
switch consecutive pairs two by two.
all reorders you get
will comprise a new set
called an alternating group when you're through.

for the cause of what's good and what's right.
all for one, one for all
is our rallying call.
hurt the one and we all will unite.

playing golf? do your shots tend to slice?
close the face of the club's my advice.
if you're tending to hook
(says my golf coaching book)
then to open its face should suffice.

she's so clumsy and careless; my wife
can't make dinner to save her own life.
the poor woman's a botcher?
for her safety, i watch her

the priest smiles benignly and bows
to miss tibbs, whom he's keen to arouse;
there's a challenge for him!
(though his prospects look slim,

it's a brown south american breed.
they live in their lairs
as monogamous pairs;
on crustaceans they frequently feed.

acrotism's a problem to dread,

i'll undo an "undo",

abundantia: goddess of luck.
pray to her and you might make a buck.
if you often play keno
at a local casino,
there's a name for you, friend, and that's schmuck!

when conducting routine operations,
i play handel and bach orchestrations.
but my scalpel hit scherzo;
i wasn't alert, so
i slipped!  (i just blamed "complications".)

a neighbor i hold in regard
told me ducks had been seen in my yard.
eyes and ears toward out back,
neither webbed feet nor quack?
i concluded 'twas just a canard.

it mixes up france with great britain,
and salvador dali
with rembrandt, by golly.
i'm miffed! as your agent i'm quittin'!

certain topics and words are taboo.
though your subject is cursable,
a curse, not conversable,
may inspire well-bred folks to pooh-pooh.

he believes it not crude

my description? that dude's adamitical.

californios settled a land
to the north that was luscious and grand.
their allegiance to spain
and to god helps explain
why francisco and bruno are san'd.

a political centrist is quite
unaligned with the left or the right.
he's a moderate who
finds the red and the blue
so extreme he prefers to be . . . white?

some towns may be sprawling and gritty,
but durham is compact and pretty.
perched high o'er the wear,
the cathedral, it's clear,
is the jewel at the heart of this city.

you can argue your case and prevail,
so some serial killer makes bail.
as a criminal lawyer
you help your employer
avoid getting locked up in jail.

it is true i enjoy eating food.
when i'm sad it can lighten my mood?
but the calorie count,
when i eat, tends to mount,
and my fears of foul fatness intrude.

this fruit, used in aztec cuisine,
was named "testicle."  sir, do you mean
avocado implies
they admired its size,
or  their bollocks were pear-shaped and green?

my name has been dragged through the mud,
since my daddy, the duke, was a dud:
his conviction for treason
remains as the reason
i suffer corruption of blood.

a scholarly gentleman courted
disaster with works unsupported.
his thoughts categorical
were so ahistorical
that nothing got properly sorted.

"as a bonus, your country club fee
lets you ride on our cart to the tee.
use our old walkie-talkie.

some soul-saving sisters in reno
erected a big baldachino,
since shelter's no sin.
now they're raking them in
at the high holy rollers casino.

my wages last year, i'm afraid,
were just chicken feed?that's what i made.
chicken feed, you'll concede,
is the right term indeed
for the poultry amount i was paid.

i'm in charge of this court, i admit.
a bencher? that's me. here i sit
and consider anew
this young con artist who
is convinced that i think he's legit.

acrolectal, as you're a jamaican
and speak creole for real, and not fakin',
means your speech is quite near
plain old english. i hear
a faint accent, unless i'm  mistaken.

and a laugh can be had from a tale,
with a loofah to scrub,
i'm aloof in the tub:
a standoffish, indifferent male.

or a record, as in
roger bannister's four-minute race.

a sculptor downtown named cornell
chisels marble and granite  to sell.
but the "carvings" he's sold
really come from a mold;
he chisels his patrons as well.

chew caramel crakes,
char conker crap cakes,
cease crying cantankerously? crouch!

a compound, you'll find, when they're done.

since her c-section, mary complains
that she aches every time that it rains.
there's no ointment or gel
that can quiet or quell
her abdominovaginal pains.

"what is that?" asked the man.  "oh, my word!"
"a blue heron or 'mile-or-more bird'."
"why, that name sounds absurd."
"that's because you've not heard:
when it craps that's the length of its turd."

our model was striking a pose,
enhanced by the absence of clothes.
i chose to suppose
that she knows there are those
trying not to expose what arose.

slash social security?  note:
that would ruin my chance with the vote
of the young generation
across this great nation.
i'd rather not cut my own throat.

when ridding a tree of dead wood
or a limb from a body, you could
say 'dismember' or think
of the cut made (wink, wink)
by l. bobbitt, who writ it in blood.

when i fell from the top of the tree,
my mom was concerned about me.
the branch where i'd stood
was of rotten old wood,
but i landed as soft as could be.

she was blushing, a beautiful bride;
an innocent virgin, untried.

certain drugs may fight neuro-disease.

the test tube or vat.
it's a new process that
all our pharmacy students are deft in."

on lovers, post-bedding.
if a spider you're wedding,
the odds are against you statistically.

i consider, with deep desperation,
the drop in our frog population.
global warming, i fear,
caused their die-off this year?
for those species, a dire decimation.

i replied, "it's 'to whom', you dumb owl."

my neighbor's just planted a spruce,
with branches wide-spreading, diffuse,
that will damage my fence
and thus cause much expense.
i have pruners; now watch me let loose.

it's at sunrise that reveille's blown
and the skills of the bugler are shown.

he's forced to get by on
one set of harmonics alone.

friday nights, at the burleycue show,
there they sat, gawking up from below:
aging bankers and schemers?
in the dark, merely dreamers?

some babas are found in a galley.
eat several and forth you will sally
to track down the bum
who stole baba au rhum

that the bard did the same.
if one genius can do it, can't two?

to render one's skin tone patrician
is the goal of a pro aesthetician.
but if looks can kill

'tis better to see a mortician.

depression advanced by the hour
in esther, a delicate flower.
though she knew that her bell jar
was surely a swell jar,
her mood was increasingly dour.

it's what a.u.c. means to imply.
count from jesus' premiere:
rome was built in that year

i regret that i cheated on you.
pray accept my oration
of lush excusation.
it grieves me that none of it's true.

down a saying of wisdom and light,
 aphorism's the name
 if the saying's not lame.

but destiny didn't betide well.
the man he waylaid

rubbing soldiers with oil?? if he's smart he
will forget this idea
and turn quickly and flee?ahh,
he's in for a sure blanket party.

as a boy was he bullied and baited
by his father, a man whom he hated?
his name is old dutch
and it doesn't mean much,
only "beet gardens", roughly translated.

erotical's old and exotic;
what we nowadays say is "erotic".
both those adjectives thrust
the conception of lust
in a way that is quasi-hypnotic.

when the order was late getting out.
"move your buns!" she would crack
to the seamstress in back,
as she busily bustled about.

an ontology really so hot.
it seems like he's boozing
with spirit infusing
absolutely all creatures, mein gott!

a number of objects (that's two);

equal, opposite forces;
yoked oxen or horses:
four meanings of couple on view.

or cystoscopy? maybe gastroscopy?
in celloidin, the tissue
is steeped in a dish; you
can slice it real thin for microscopy.

'cause a capo's the bar you should get.
on the neck, it's a snap,
held in place by a strap,
so there's never a reason to fret.

in the past they taught writing coercively;
smooth curves came out lovely and cursively.
fine form but no rhymes
flowing thousands of times;

though his name's often linked with timidity,
ambrose burnside, with seeming rapidity,
gained a great reputation
while serving his nation

there's a hole, straight and true,
from one side and right through,
so it fits on a string well indeed.

so i come to the word alkahestic,

the solvent it names

alisphenoid? of course it is dull!
well, it took a few hours to mull
over how to harass
my anatomy class.
i said, "draw all the bones in the skull."

you enter new hampshire and sigh,
as you've spotted the sign, driving by,
since you didn't expect

a collop's not meant for the plough,
it's the size that the land will allow.
it's the pasture that's needed

this double depression
in rapid succession
instead of just one click is slick.

from the city rooms, there at our papers,

of mayoral aides
caught in bawdy-house raids.
of opinion, our papers are shapers.

since distressedness may be a state
of great pain, an unfortunate fate,
call the doctor to say
you need help right away.
disclose facts like the feasts that you ate.

we lost money non-stop,
and our air castle fell with a crash.

no pardon is coming.
the gov won't be slumming

who had typhoid that led to amentia.
he then crawled on all fours
and gnawed at the doors
feeling certain his name was rodentia.

in zoology's view,
it describes me and you,
as our heat comes from under our skin.

it sells playthings of marvelous sorts
and equipment for little kids' sports.
it's a landmark; what's more,
it's my favorite store?
the cool toyshop called fao schwarz.

checkered whiptail lizards reside
in the dry, rocky landscape outside.
they eat bugs and are wary
of anything scary,
darting off to the shadows to hide.

if that restaurant's serving a beer
that they brew in a vat in the rear,
and they're making the ale
that they offer for sale
with the food, it's a brewpub, you hear?

independent or bound by a pact;
off the wall or conventional;
in general, intentional:
a deed is a purposeful act.

true amateurs, often decried,
should take all such slurs in their stride,
since working for love
must come well above
their working while ungratified.

my passion?what rapture!
i'm deeply and fully engrossed.

when no aeroplane takes off or lands, it

and to sit on one's luggage in transit.

you're wrong, sir, with all due respect:
exoneration's too much to expect.
you predict you'll be free?
i'm afraid that won't be.
when you sideswiped that nun, you were wrecked.

in drafting a note to my love,
i'd compared her to heaven above,
but, alas and alack,
with these words it came back:
"please insert in your rectum and shove."

it describes a continuing state.
compare thrash, strike, and hit;
just the first, you'll admit,
will occur over time, then abate.

the sargasso sea, teeming with kelp,
lashed by winds, almost drowned out the yelp
of my dog. i cried, "heck!"
he'd been swept from the deck
and that yelp was my dog's cry for help.

just study alone 'til you're practic-

"you can talk!?" balaam gasped, staff in hand.
"had no choice," said his ass. "i was banned
by a sword from the path;
you're unsubtle in wrath;

just a drainplug dislodged from its hole.

for the harness, i made a new belt
not of hide (that is, fell) but of felt.
i can see, from the start,
felt (not fell) falls apart
as my horses and cart cross the veldt.

carbon offsetting's goals i can see,
but should i ponder planting a tree
when those four-by-fours drink
our resources? i think
that their drivers should walk just like me.

that blood blister under her thumb
is a sign of how utterly dumb
is my bloody big sister.
the door would have missed her,

knitting fast as her fingers were able.
the twists in the wool
made the sweater so full,
employing the stitch known as cable.

with petals arranged to be showery.
but the cr?che and bocage

well, perhaps i was too quick to fret,
so i send this response with regret.
there is growth as of late
on my shiny new pate.
now i look like a large chia pet.

it looks scalloped, to put it in brief.

the term arbitrable means you can settle
a matter without courtroom mettle.
you meet and decide
to be peaceful, not snide.
no black-calling pot (to a kettle).

once you figure out when
for each incident, then
who, what, where, how, and why will be prime.

if you'll spot me some money right now,
i will purchase a bovine, and vow
that each month i'll respond

all the people?both near and remote.
the statistics we're getting
are needed for setting
the congress the next time we vote.

how deceptive a cadence can sound.

it's our blood?like the gas in our tank:
those red blood cells that we have to thank

there are white ones, for when
wounds infect, or we'll die, to be frank.

crisis management might be your call:
you fix meltdowns and mayhem forestall.
others see far ahead,
put small problems to bed?
almost never have crises at all.

cousin jane, although eager to greet
any scandal that comes to her street,

the judge's decision
brought shame and derision.

breathe a word to a soul and we're dead.

they say artemis, bathing, was caught
by actaeon, which made her distraught.
so she, as a gag,
turned him into a stag
and his dogs ate him up on the spot.

this breakdown explains
all our losses and gains
to see if our spending's defensible.

"dear john, though it causes me pain,
i have tried to remain,
but you drive me insane,

sprouting wires from its ears?a machine?
then it put down its tripod
and took off its ipod,
leaving merely a bipedal teen.

i'll play snare drums each night,
write long screeds full of spite,
and my booby-trapped loo will explode you.

just by watching tv?
cable's cheaper than school, i suppose.

i read blurbs on the back.  in the flaps,
i read summarized contents.  perhaps
if the book jacket's piquing
my interest, i'm seeking

its long neck reached with ease

i can't sleep for the worry and stress,
since i lost our first folio
and caused an embroglio?
a troublesome, turbulent mess!

so much strength, still he kept striking out.
we'd been pretty dejected;
one day he connected.
since then, he's hit clout after clout.

"watch that crotchety crank!" warned the nurse.
but he heard, and to make matters worse,
threw his bedpan and tray
in a colourful spray,

this strange hunger, this need?
on what stuff does it feed?
it's like time, this enduring edacity.

it seems, in our local sinfonia,

spinal tap got some feedback? a whine?
which they thought could be something malign.
