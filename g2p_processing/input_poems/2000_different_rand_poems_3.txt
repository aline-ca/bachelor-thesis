when some furriers looking for glory
strode up a steep hill from their dory,
they founded a town
that would rise in renown.

a cheerful young vampire named drac,
an undead, stays abed, in the sack,
rising every so often
up out of his coffin,
and sanguinely fixing a snack.

guess i'll cook up some fresh calabrese.
when my husband walks in,
he'll go into a spin,
"me eat broccoli? you must be nuts!"

there's a doctrine, eternal return:
endless cycles are there to discern.

as we've lived it, there's hope we may learn.

if your corn crops are stricken with blight,
and your horses fall lame in the night,

conjuration just might put things right.

be remembered as athens' high court.

scrape and stir to make sauce;  it's amazing!
intense flavor's produced

it's a cooking technique that's worth praising.

"for defense," rocky made this recital,
"build a tower of pebbles. it's vital."
but he ran into trouble?
no cement? now it's rubble.
rocky's rocks in that field are detrital.

but take care when you're nosing
round lives now reposing,

she lost grip. her last breath:

the birds here are grand
in new zealand, this land

to crowds made him choose self-expulsion.
he was seen with a frown

his home moved?from the river's avulsion!

i've been reading the newspapers dreadingly
as the flu epidemic comes spreadingly,
and i'm scared 'cause aunt sue
has a bad case of flu,
and the viruses fall from her sheddingly.

i'll forgo all life's pleasures exotic,

'neath a tree, bread and wine,
plus a book?just divine!
all the things i like best are demotic.

i had problems that day.  in particular,
no way could i stay perpendicular
to our spacecraft in flight,
so i couldn't get right

anne pm'ed me from out of the blue.
with computers our major,
her text was, i'd wager,
a coincidence, truly: "diku?"

she opined cry it out

you're receiving a dire diagnosis:
your doc says "it's fasciolosis."
you feel more than annoyed,
'cause your liver's destroyed.
it's enough to bring on a neurosis.

my great dane, i'm afraid, is a chewer,
so the shoes in my closet are fewer.
i bought slippers last may,
but i'm sorry to say
that today they are canine manure.

the ayasofya in turkey

it jumped in a lurch
from a church to a church
to a mosque? in a way, belief jerky.

they're silly, not knotty or naughty;

so you'll find here defined
one fine word on my mind, namely forty.

i was stunned as she pressed
his foul hand to her breast.

all rules of decorum he's flouting.
this bletherskate's ranting

a blackout: their light still survives.

they're frogs, so don't slip 'em the tongue!

while it's true that i could have been blunter,
through my words, i am still an affronter.
  the words that i used
  left her ego so bruised!
(but i still think she's fatter than gunter.)

with additive printing?
primarily blue, red and green.

take a glass and add four cubes of ice,
then add grapefruit juice: two shots is nice.
  add a shot of light rum,

boiling blood is a sign

while some art, and some lifestyles, might chime
with the dominant mood of the time,
for a less mainstream feast
read my worktop with yeast?
counter-culture's alive in my rhyme.

feeling peaky, i dosed my clam chowder
with strong antimonial powder.
this algaroth stew
sent me straight to the loo,
where my retching grew louder and louder.

our ethically-challenged big boss

in my beautiful garden of coleus,
i encountered papilio demoleus

if they swear or they curse,
the results are no worse
than a mouthful of punitive soap.

demibastion: a part of a fort.
its objective: armed onslaughts to thwart.

the demand letter, found in my post,
made no bones: "pay up now, or you're toast."
in the light of my plight
i am on the first flight
out of sight, to sit tight on the coast.

my daughter adores chocolate cake.
"lots of brownies, oh daddy, please bake."
though a girl-guide she's not,
when she's scoffed the whole lot,
she's a browny-faced girl, no mistake.

their monstrous capacity

i've no butt i can bandy about
since i've taken the dieting route.
after months i can see
(at a hundred-and-three)
that my weight may be bottoming out.

you cattails and rushes love muds
where the earth periodically floods.
you're emergent; why care
if a pond is down there,
when your stalk's high and dry with your buds?

"maisy loved michelangelo's dome?
wants to cart it away
piece by piece to la?

never fearing defeat,
every foe he will beat
with impressive resolve and persistence.

of great interest to dupont and gore,
not to mention the chef?
it's the source of the f
which makes teflon and gore-tex and more.

in a land that depends on agronomy,
a boycott can wreck the economy.
the old captain won't rise

the word boycott's a case of eponymy.

so you skimped on your breakfast at eight;
then attenuate light,
but at noon lost the fight
when you saw yourself eat and inflate.

you're a moth larva out in tibet?
becoming a mummy's a threat.
certain fungi intrude;
they will use you as food
and then sprout?a macabre duet.

that the jumbers are numbled. he's vexed.
decipherment's tough
when the hode's card enough;

my son will confront with hostility
when he really should punt with civility.

old ed's hearing aids cost him a ton?
told his friend that they're second to none.
asked "what kind are they?" he

when he saw jill's new cadillac, phil
reacted against his own will.
his mouth just dropped open.
he shut it quick, hopin'
she wouldn't stick him with the bill.

each morning she faces a hurdle
as gertie squirms into her girdle,
yet it isn't her shape
but her face (like an ape)
that will scare you and make your blood curdle.

bite off more than you're able to chew,
and high levels of stress may ensue.
making too many plans
spreads you thin with demands?
wastes your time and your energy too.

while a luff is the edge of a sail,
and a laugh can be had from a tale,
with a loofah to scrub,
i'm aloof in the tub:
a standoffish, indifferent male.

said berta, "i've got a confession:
though you thought i devised the expression
for 'erythrocyte center,'
i'm not the inventor:
german delle means 'dent' or 'depression.'"

he fed me a bunch of baloney an'
affected to be apollonian.
a passel of rot,
because noble he's not,
so i told him what's what; i'm draconian.

when the challenge demands urgent action,
but it's tougher than teak to gain traction,
buckle to; strain the sinew;
give all that is in you,
and your sweat will yield sweet satisfaction.

i don't normally boast, but i'll claim
that i once had a close brush with fame,
when i boarded the train
to an airport in spain
with that singer... (oh, what was his name?)

her antediluvian stance
didn't give the merengue a chance;
she could even find faults
with the old-fashioned waltz,
so she never consented to dance.

we are so far apart, you and i;
i'm beneath you, and you're way up high.
you ran off, broke your vow;
that was then, this is now.
sign me: deictically yours, and goodbye.

can altruism actually be fact,
as when it is claimed and then backed
with the acts of a saint?
i'd say most of us ain't
thus behaved 'cause our angel-gene's whacked.

when something is bogus, it's phony,
like the grifters and pitchmen at coney.
it will make you disgusted;
it just can't be trusted.
it's counterfeit, fake?it's baloney.

i'm dating a charming young lad
who is always most dashingly clad.
when my debonair fellow
wore suits pinkish-yellow,
he started an apricot fad.

where things snap, come adrift, slip and slide,
extra measures are wisely applied.
belt and braces ensure
pants are doubly secure?
metaphorically too? a good guide.

a summons has come, and, oh my!
it says to be present, or die.
i object to that tone,
so i'll say (on the phone)
that i can't bring myself to comply.

in the army a unit with flair

it's a cavalry troop
(without horses or poop)

your body's decrepit and worn,
and increasingly looking forlorn.
yet you've learned, with chagrin,
that you can't trade it in,
since the warranty's void, once you're born.

said the fool, "from my climb up this hill,
i still, day after day, get a thrill.
with my head in the cloud
while the beetles are loud,
it's my everyday cardio drill."

i am flexibly challenged with age;
i don't bend well? i've now reached the stage
where i wake feeling so
far from limber, i know
my stiff ribs have no give in their cage.

so courteously he behaves:
not content with unmannerly waves,
he will cross over roads
to carry the loads
of old ladies not far from their graves.

that acardiac girl won't be wooed.
at my amorous song she just booed.
she's so heartless, you see;
not a kind word for me.
for my love she can never be food.

the motto for some: "life's a beach,"
while for others it's: "into the breach!"
we debate a world view;
it's irrelevant to

my in-laws: i love 'em divinely!
their joking is all done benignly.
  while i was asleep
  they ignited my jeep.
oh, these jesters, related affinely.

or the kind of a cough that goes "whoop!"
you give antibiotics.
my mom shuns exotics;
her chicken soup works?that's the scoop!

for a kayak adventure  pursuit,
go the length of the mighty chubut:
from andes to ocean
in easterly motion,
the cross-patagonian route.

"i can handle my booze!" that was bunk,
since my uncle is constantly drunk.
once he downed 20 beers
and then said, "it appears
i'm not sober as much as i thunk!"

i'm the spurious scythian lamb:
i'm half-plant and half-beastie, i am!
all the fur on my fern
made the barometz turn
a few heads?but alas! i'm a sham.

do you know the ex-congressman who
thought payola was strictly taboo?
after years in the place,
he has turned "about face";
now a lobbyist's life he'll pursue.

"allelujah!" it shouts, as my soul
in its joy praises being. the whole
of me joins in the joyful
elation; my boy-ful
self feels it's arrived at soul's goal.

a rowdy young redneck named clive
once started a brawl in a dive.
he was looking for fun,
but he didn't get none.
now he's lucky to still be alive.

"cash or check?"  kiss me now?  kiss me later?
would be asked of a "dame" when you'd date her
in the 20s, back when
all the bimbos were men,
and a gal was a "doll" or "tomater."

to dislimn does not mean "to dislimb".
(they are homophones, sounding so sim-
ilar.) do not efface
or on impulse erase
works of art. (don't dislimn on a whim.)

first she waits, in the church, for a while;
then solemnly walks down the aisle
to the altar, all prim,
mumbles "yes", sings a hymn,
thinking "i'll alter him" with a smile.

mom's explained what i may and i mayn't,
so my life will be one of restraint.
and as soon as i die,
i'll be canonized. why?
mom'd faint if i cain't be a saint.

a digestive is something you sip
at the end of a gut-busting rip
of a dinner; it calms
your intestinal qualms,
and prevents you from losing your grip.

when you hinder what tries to pass by,
or impede someone's view of the sky,
or restrict an exchange,
or reduce something's range,
then you're serving to block or deny.

though it's not my ambition to loll 'em
to sleep with my bi-weekly column,
my editor thought
stock analysis ought
to be colorless, boring, and solemn.

in england, a check is a cheque;
pay your bills either way? what the heque.
is my head on my neque?
can a kiss be a peque?
(how much more can you stand of this dreque?)

overrated, i'd say, is my zeal
to make of the foolish a meal.
of the sum that i write
they are only a bite:
a tidbit is not a big deal.

jack's assigned a new area code,
ostensibly, easing the load
caused by cellphones and faxes.
"but overlays," jack says,
"are taxing, our survey just showed."

while preparing to pay off the bill
to the store for my barbecue grill,
i uncovered some trouble:
those crooks charged me double!
the discovery gave me a chill.

the panamint mountains are tall.
almost twelve thousand feet you can fall
to the badwater basin?
that death valley place in
the states that's the lowest of all.

affright means "to terrify greatly,"
a task made more difficult lately
by horror films stark?
no more "boo!" in the dark,
which before might have scared us innately.

sell your properties fast: save your skin!
brickor mortis has clearly set in.
all the agents keep trying,
but no one is buying.
some fat cats are stylishly thin.

the word cabriole means, to a man
who's a dancer, a step that he can
do while jumping in air?
but the leg of a chair
to a fan of the style called queen anne.

a succulent plant that was cactiform
hung down from the cave roof, stalactiform.
from its tip, liquid dripping
seemed perfect for sipping?
a purified essence extractiform.

it's soft, or it's hard, or it's small,
or it's large; when it's dropped, it'll fall.
it's usually round,
but an oblong one found
in an end zone abounds?it's a ball.

the effigy burning right now
was yesterday's most sacred cow.
when the people rebel
then the statues they fell
are of tyrants they now disavow.

since my writing's confined to a zone
(with some letters uniquely my own),
it's in fact epichoric,
like greeks who spoke doric
in corinth (though not as well-known).

i have aged, and discovered, alas,
that my back and my waist and my ass
underwent consolidation?
solidification
into one shapeless unified mass.

a desire that is out of control,
cacoethes, in life, plays a role.
if you're feeling the surge
of a powerful urge,
you can splurge and make pleasure your goal.

antilynching laws sadly were blocked;
by senate rules voting was locked.
the filibuster, used
to keep action defused,
left democracy seemingly mocked.

the cream cake was worth every taste,
even though it went right to my waist.
i ate the whole piece.
though my weight did increase,
in a week, the two pounds were erased.

our toilet's as foul as can be,
and my wife knows the problem is me.
pretty pissed, she demands,
"stop the 'look-ma-no-hands'!
get ahold of yourself when you pee."

when i visit ren?e's french chalet
in vouvray, every evening we play
this old card game for two?
and i haven't a clue
why i lose like i do??cart?.

we've had nine, if you count the confessor.
(kings edward, that is.)  the successor
to victoria's throne
was her eldest son, known
as "bertie" or ted the caressor.

to compensate parents,  i'd leave,
as repayment for joys that they weave,
a brief time for reflection
and sharing affection?
just a space for deep breaths, christmas eve.

my country and i are depressed,
for our values are shaky at best.
we have traded ideals
for more automobiles;
now by anomie we are possessed.

the young grifter's proposed dirty deal
was misleading, the dishonest heel.
his bad faith guarantee
was intended for me,
but i saw what he tried to conceal.

hung all over with glittering riders,
with presents for lobby insiders,
a christmas tree bill
up on capitol hill
can link soybeans with supercolliders.

please extinguish all lights not in use;
then our energy costs we'll reduce.
please attend to my fervent
green plea: be conservant?
not wasteful; there is no excuse.

my level's three-ten; i'm alive,
but they say there's no way i'll survive.
my cholesterol's high
and the doctors don't lie:
i'll be dead ere i finish line...

since my heart misses beats, i've begun
using antiarrhythmics, class i.
i take conquinine first
(it's just quinine, reversed),
but the side-effects aren't any fun.

louisa may alcott was brimmin'
with stories about little women.
when she wrote as a. barnard,
adult praise was garnered
for tales wild as unripe persimmon.

most pianos are uprights or grands
and of various sizes and brands.
be they one- or two-seaters,
it's inches or meters.
a concert grand's 28 hands.

when salmon is raised on a farm,
it is bland, and it may cause you harm,
since that lovely pink tint
(let me give you a hint)
is just coloring?sound the alarm!

foretelling's defined as the art
of predicting the end at the start.
an example: the knowledge
i had during college?
my girlfriend would soon break my heart.

"you're a damn worthless cretin, sir knight!
i am better than you: i would fight
off a rampaging horde!"
quoth the mad king, who roared
rather arrogantly: sure he was right.

cenerentola (yes, cinderella)
is an opera where singers will tell a
tale of underdog winning,
but from the beginning,
we can tell she'll do well with her fella.

"is the caller there?" phil wants to know
on his program (now canceled).  "hello?"
people used to call in,
"i'm in love with my twin,"
thus becoming a part of the show.

diversion with pleasures enshrined
and revelers bawdily wined
with bacchus and venus
entwining between us
is anacreontic defined.

of nefarious doings i tell:
alexander (the great) graham bell
simply took, without mention,
meucci's invention,
his fame, and his fortune as well.

the girls who wear tight dungarees
nibble food that's unlikely to please:
curd cheese topping a salad,
all lumpy and pallid
(we now call that stuff cottage cheese).

a country whose culture's anomic
is one that is quite tragicomic.
this social unrest
can lead, i suggest,
to failures of things economic.

disproportionately rude are all those
who mess with, in public, their nose.
these same think it macho
to scratch at their crotch?oh,
and brrrt any time they propose.

in my twenties, a tank top looked fab
with whichever ol' shorts i might grab.
now my arm-flesh looks better
in a dolman-sleeved sweater.
(extra fabric conceals all the flab.)

there's a minimum number of hues
that to colour a graph you must use.
since it's points you may mean
or the lines in between,
there are two of these values, so choose.

is defining this suffix just doable?
it's safer than one which is sueable.
it's clear, if i can,
i'm a cleverer man
than the bloke who is too not-a-clueable.

blenheim palace (that's blen-uhm to you)
isn't cool as a pad, dude, it's true,
but it has got a claim
on hip woodstock's great name?
and some churchill guy lived there once, too.

on technology, tubes, and retorts,
and in geeky domains of all sorts,
i can chatter with ease?
i'm conversant with these?
but my god, do not quiz me on sports!

name the game: sixty-one bonus squares
on the board, where each player compares
clever lexical skill,
choosing letters to fill
in the scrabble for words from his wares.

the air-droppable cargo we fly
(mostly food and supplies they can't buy)
will be tethered to chutes
and released over routes
where they're easy for people to spy.

to write poems, i gladly confess,
is a task with which i acquiesce.
if you find you agree,
tip the wink here to me;
accede quickly, in case i digress.

when my friend displayed grief that seemed deep,
i was shocked and asked, "why do you weep?"
"we just euthanized daniel;
our old cocker spaniel
had cancer?we put him to sleep."

a belt goes on one of its rants:
"why don't nobody gimme a chance?
i got nabbed by the cops?
they're just bustin' my chops.
seems they're claimin' i held up some pants."

though you know things adorned with a bow
may be gifts that i plan to bestow,
it's a rule that's untrue
when applied to my shoe.
child of mine, you have got to let go.

the art which describes, or expounds,
the length, or duration, of sounds
is echometry named?
like the art that is aimed
at producing high echo surrounds.

your hormones, produced by the system
called endocrine? none can resist 'em.
your gonads are glands
that make urgent demands;
they take over your brains and they twist 'em.

job and school, at my mother's insistence,
are both ten miles from home (equidistance),
but the fact i like least:
one's due west; one's due east.
it's the bane of my teenage existence.

a chicken lays eggs, that is true,
and, yes, we've laid more than a few.
but, most of the time,
a chicken can't rhyme
while it's clucking away, like we do.

explored through a marxist analysis,
the fate of the queen, my dear alice, is
disclosed dialectically:
her house will fall hectically?
flamingos will overthrow palaces!

back onto the dregs. at what cost?
lots of charcoal, i'd say.
it's an alchemist's way
to concentrate what has been lost.

were some guys drinking whiskey? what losers!
so i said, "chug some beer!
or you're out on your rear;
for at keggers, there cannot be boozers."

do it poorly?the sap will be mad.
so don't mention you've had her;
there is no breach that's badder.

the moon is a beautiful sphere
that delights us some nights when it's clear,
but it seems to change girth
as it circles the earth
twelve (or is it thirteen?) times a year.

don't pretend there is real competition;
these youngsters have naught but ambition.
you know i'm the best;
on my laurels, let's rest.
i suggest we just skip the audition.

the subscription, twelve dollars p.a.,
(that's per annum the long-winded way)

hard to find a sub smaller,

my friend fran always brings home her mates

strapped my rhinestone-tipped lagerfeld lash on.
my hair-shirt's design
is the new calvin klein.

but i love it a whole lot, and so
when i long for a treat
of chocolate to eat,

said the actor in trying to deal
with those goats by the cows,
"so in taking our bows,

the bazaar in the streets of dakar
offers goods from both near and afar.
since they fit lingerie
in the light of the day,
you can buy a brassiere! how bizarre!

as a purist, i often resent
where a climbing bolt aids the ascent,
where it lures the unwary.
mountaineering is hairy;
these anchors were not god's intent.

when getting the heroine stripped,
why's her bodice so typically ripped?
better chance of romance,
getting into her pants,
would be getting her zipper unzipped.

a diapir rash comes from slidin'
down a domed rock formation and ridin'
the core that breaks through,
and has nothing to do
with those parenting skills you take pride in.

"had i first turned the key in the door lock,
then my manservant (tugging his forelock)
would not have come in
to announce, with a grin,
'scuse me, sir, there's this person from porlock.' ..."

in the army, a captain called rob
liked to mess with the military mob.
with his friendly palm proffered
young privates were offered
a handshake? or even a job.

architourists in busloads agree:
in each town, architecture is key.
please stop blocking their view.
no one cares about you;
it's the buildings they're coming to see.

a whistler at work gave me pause?
what's the opposite word for "applause"?
so while holding my nose
i made noises like crows.
(i've been told i was fired for cause.)

though his name might suggest it, i trust
that the coal tit's not covered in dust.
like his cousin the blue tit,
this much-paler-hue tit,
though tiny, is still upper crust.

"there's a high horse-drawn carriage," says jake,
"with four wheels, that is known as a break.
if you see it spelled b-,"
he adds, "r-a-k-e-,
that's permitted and not a mistake."

with his god-awful smelly cheroot,
ruben smoot burned a hole in my lute.
when i took him to court
as a final resort,
a consent decree settled my suit.

it's a classic?not really a new berry,
that to yankees is known as the dewberry.
we all know, i suppose,
that on bushes it grows?
more a blackberry, rather than blueberry.

you, but now is your time
to get off of the dime."
i'm the thousandth and final investor.

pass a rope or a hook or a bar
through an eyehole? that isn't bizarre.
but your eyeball should not
get such things in its slot.
such insertions stretch eyehole too far.

his coneys contract enteritis.
"it's the bloat!" bewails poor farmer titus.
they're distended with gas;
should it happen to pass
that they die, rabbit stew will delight us.

"tell me true. am i hart? am i hind?"
questioned bambi, unsure of his kind.
"it does seem to me
that i'm always called 'she,'
which means that i ... oh, never mind!"

she had promised unlimited bliss
if i changed her to "mrs." from "miss."
twelve kids later, i find
to my lot i'm resigned,
but i sure didn't bargain on this!

he was struck in the head once again.
his right temple experienced pain,
but the damage to tissue
was more of an issue
on the opposite side of his brain.

rubbish, tripe, twaddle, balderdash, bunk,
pure preposterous meaningless junk,
garbage, falderal, babble,
rot, trash, jabber, gabble
describes the dumb things that you thunk.

all i say you just twist and pervert.
my emotions you treat worse than dirt.
constant verbal abuse
really bruises me, bruce,
on the inside? my feelings are hurt.

at thanksgiving, though slightly unstable,
i get implements (far as i'm able)
fully sharpened and pointed
so the turkey's disjointed
without skidding too far from the table.

he gave his old suit a quick brush
and was out of the house in a rush.
now the cat hairs are gone
as he runs cross the lawn
and falls flat on his face in the slush.

with spermatophytes, one thing i know:
they have seed leaves when starting to grow.
cotyledonous seeds
serve to furnish the  needs
of the seedling; a start they bestow.

hey, we'd play every day if we could!
in our hoop-de-doo dreams,
we lead nba teams

with the odds past a million to one
(that's against you), it's frightening.
go try to catch lightning
in a bottle?it just can't be done!

i took cackleberries out of the carton,
boiled, and peeled 'em.  egg salad i'm startin'
with mayo and relish.
it's swell, but what's hellish?
the smells that come later from fartin'.

magisterial, edictal, stern,
the tough judge said, "a deaf ear i turn
to this last mercy plea,"
at which louts danced with glee,
chanting, "burn baby, burn baby, burn!"

it will get you from dallas to boise

a lifer is gone?been shot dead!
i am sporting a frown
'cause the joint is locked down,

disagree if you like; i'll contend
that a bat is the bricklayer's friend.
though it's handy to throw,
if you did, it would show,
for the bond would have gaps at the end.

these productions are not realistic.
they're eurotrash: sexy, sadistic,

round that dubious snow-covered mound.
and we ask if, first thing,

the master and student debate
how to move a whole mountain so great.

either that, or it's part of helsinki.

each was buried, instead,
in another man's head.
just a few stayed alive, but not very.

in his artery sat
a deposit of fat,

every colorless chromogen waits
with electron p-orbital states,
its transitions from pi
all unseen by the eye,

they bake for are likely to savor.

with dennis the menace and gnasher,
the beano was always a smasher.
the numskulls, plug, billy,

friends and family have flown;

common cultural forms for our clan.
we have fears: "who are we?

your presumptuous show

but the other guy's broke, and that's plain.

candace bushnell is really quite witty;
her novels are saucy and gritty.
she's the queen of chick lit,
penning hit after hit:

all the golfers agreed
on the source of its speed:

yes, balsamic plants, all balsamaceous,
yield balsam; it's sticky, sebaceous.
and if resin you need

while outdated, it's still efficacious.

when our maker was handing out sticks,
dolly daydreams got all in a mix.
to get hold of which end

though she cannot keep time,
she believes she's a prime

that would ruin my chance with the vote
of the young generation
across this great nation.
i'd rather not cut my own throat.

in this demiworld, hoodlums and thugs
have a culture that's centered on drugs.
each develops a need?
whether weed, h, or speed,
and for money to buy it, each mugs.

children crase things; they're rash; they astound.
fragile objects can break,

lacking vigour, alertness or zest.
in despondency's grip,
i continue to slip
down a slope to?who cares? i'm depressed.

one who dissertates must be informed,
to his subject be properly warmed,
and display erudition
to maintain his position.
should he blunder, the stage will be stormed.

after diving in china's south seas,
he showed symptoms of caisson disease.
too quickly he went
upon his ascent,
and the bends brought that man to his knees.

fashionistas? they're bashin' and trashin';
for designers they show no compassion.
with no pity for those
who designed clothes for shows,
these same "clothes-hos" cash in on their fashion.

ken suggested a great coadventure.
i agreed, but i later would censure
my date for his grossness.
he ruined our closeness,

doctor beeching, you need a good birching!

the new mizzen we added is set,
but i think that's the best it'll get.

i assume that your fancies are torrid;

you need not bring a diaper or bib.
there is no need to roam.
you may stay in my home.
as a housemate i'm great. that's no fib.

of integrity pols are bereft.
a damn beauty contest's all we have left.
each event's neatly staged,

and is stern about whisky and gin.

her doctor advised, "on reflection,
good hygiene provides some protection,
but you've picked up a fungus
that's common among us:
a candida vaginal infection."

it's a fiddling sum, and why so?
the fit payment for plying a bow?
no, it's trifling and petty,
a pinch of confetti,
not worthy remark, don't you know?

those ads for "hired hand" i'll peruse,

some were used in the day
of the tintype (that's way

in the sun-dappled depths of the dale
my plants are all healthy and hale.
down there it's the right shade

a punch that i brought to the dance
was exclusively cognac from france.
i admit i'm excuseless
