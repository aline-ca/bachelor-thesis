poor control of the rudder

a crowfoot grass plant tends to stray,
and with mat-forming stems makes its way;
it succeeds and self-seeds
and exceeds most weed breeds
in its number of seeds: 60k!

well, it's down in my shed, in the rear,
with the rest of my well-drilling gear.
but why all the suspicion
and such inquisition
of where i have bentonite, dear?

ancient artists have drawn us;

my doctor's the best, i proclaim;
examining throats is his game.
he's a whiz at his job,
has a knack with a swab?
and the wizard of ahs is his name.

a borough's a place folk inhabit,
not fast-breeding rodents, dagnabit!
in america, though,
they pronounce it "burrow".

an abundance, in fact,

education is key.
"teach the children" should be
our most basic, unbreakable vow.

altitudinous places are fine

its loftiness lies
in my mortgage's size

the conservator had to decide
if the "venus" by rubens (so wide
that the canvas had ripped)
should be stretched and then stripped
before stitching her ample backside.

in order to not be divisive,
at a minimum, don't be derisive
of one side or belief,

better neutral than wrongly decisive.

i've been dialing and smiling since nine
to close deals down this telephone line.

like the pungent aroma of piss'll.

i've got dentoalveolar pain
and bad breath that's so foul i'm a bane.
having teeth with deep pockets
of pus in their sockets,
i've emptied this car of the train.

i'd be flying with ease and no care,
but i feel there's a "humph!" in the air!
perpendicular breezes
(like teasing with wheezes)
blow crossly, so fly if you dare!

there's flatfish all over the plaice!

celia's eager to make a connection,

"you haven't a hope, kid, in hell!"

see the lace, all hand-stitched, and the braid
weaving round every gem

a new tone issues forth from my throat:
not a fifth or a third,
but so near it's absurd.

shops send overdue bills
to your dad. we get chills

but when sentimentality
trumps rationality,
limericks founder bathetically.

when an educator runs out of gas,
and the end of her job comes to pass,
it's not like you or i:

the process of anglicization:
"making english" a people or nation.
in victoria's days
they found numerous ways
to make such a grand transformation.

this critic's of minor repute;
his empathy's much too acute:
the awful soprano
who shrieked through "? strano!"
he called "just minutely argute."

for first class or best.
apersey and the rest

who bosses me 'round like he's bwana.
it sticks in my craw

that cydonia is sculpted,  but since
it includes the odd shape,
not quite human or ape,
are you sure that it isn't a quince?

in my dreams, we're chirurgeonly mergin'.

can provide such a nip
in a train or a bus or a tram.

my pal kirk is a bit of a jerk,

playing possum's a ruse
since he thinks that a snooze

the pressman said, "here's what we're inter.
we are printing this money."

seeing hives filled with honey, i freeze;
please spare me from oceans
and leafy green motions,
for bees, seas, and trees make me sneeze.

growing old; i'll just stay here in bed.

but that's never gonna
be network nirvana!
his term of employment's expiring.

a lack of acclaim isn't gonna
stop me playing with words if i wanna.
yes, my puns are deplored,
but who needs an award?
annomination itself is an honor!

dirty tricks have corrupted elections,
with their lies spread to trigger defections
from one party's voters
(remember swift boaters?)
and snuck in too late for corrections.

antiduelling laws were ignored,
and for centuries pistol and sword
gave one's honor its due,
while today we just sue
and draw blood through a hefty award.

that doctor put drops in my eyes,
made my pupils both double in size.

but i hope it won't cause my demise.

dr. love, won't you answer my call
since i haven't been laid since last fall?

that your conjugal harmony's fled?
your domestic debate

and the others you steer
to the overseas lands that you're courting.

when his family has chinese descent.

to show off rare words, i'm ambitious.
i'm alert for occasions auspicious,
when i'll add one word more
to what i said before:
the obsolete word addititious.

this word, more archaic than old,
is as rare and as precious as gold.
to spread round its use, i'll
assert circumfusile
is "spreadable round" (so i'm told).

as podocarpaceae go,

or if you're a yank or a roo-sian?

it's a small kind of rope
to give sailors some hope
when the wind is a moderate gale.

my senses attuned, blood's a-flowing.
i'm barely held in,

to control conductivity.

who can stand all this mind-numbing pain?
when it's constant, it's always a drain.
there are pills that will dull
the loud drums in my skull?
will they keep me from going insane?

dehumanization? insanity!
it's not just a blow to one's vanity.
if one's forced to conform,
made to follow the norm,

i'm afraid that they may end up dead,
so i search through the train

teddy roosevelt, clearly, he's not,
in a play folks enjoy quite a lot.
they don't mind that he's nuts
since, no ifs, ands or buts,
his derangement is key to the plot.

for bodily waste.?
or, to say it with taste:

knowing just what to do,
she thought: "first, i'll bring to,
