of girls? so i'll be a musician.

san francisco's famed cable cars creep
up some hills that make acrophobes weep.
"get a grip" is their hope
as they head down the slope;
the declivitous street is so steep.

a blue chip, an equity stake,
is the best kind of bet you can make,
with a name known and trusted,
a purse gold-encrusted,
and dividends, part of the take.

each capetian was royal (fran?ais),
and descended from hugh, a capet.
being first to the throne
in this line, hugh was known
for his skill putting rivals away.

we consultants all fear and we dread time
that's idle; it's not-earning-bread time.
when jobless, we yearn
to get busy, return
to a schedule without any dead time.

to take messages, summon or page
in hotels, on a train or on stage,
a callboy's enough.
for massages and stuff,
a call girl is the one to engage.

a barkantine, schooner, and cutter
are at sea with their sails all aflutter.
their first mates all shout
"reef 'em in! let them out!"
and "what are ya, mate? some kinda nutter?"

damn! i wish that i wasn't so bold,
but a round-the-world trip promised gold.
now i'm here in this plane
seeking howland in vain?
that pacific looks pretty but cold.

"composing sticks these days are rare,"
said pete, "and i think that it's fair
to say that my printing
now owes more to glinting
computers than typesetters' care."

the erosion is patently clear.
but how much has eroded round here?
use the bubnoff, it's great.
it's the rubbin' off rate
of just one micrometre per year.

"howdy vern. say, how deep is your well?"
"it's about eighty feet. what's up, mel?
think your cat's fallen in?"
"no, my wife, becky-lynn."
"well, i guess that explains the odd smell."

at our house, i'm the cranberry boss.
i abominate canned berry dross.
why is mine so damned dandy?
it's fresh berries and brandy?
gives new meaning to hitting the sauce.

let's face it, i know i'm a lush,
getting red in the face as i rush
to imbibe every day
three carafes of ros?.
like the vino i drink, i'm ablush.

a condition with great specificity,
it can fracture a family's felicity?
peanut allergy can
kill a woman or man,
due to peanuts' strong antigenicity.

some people avoid altercation
by engaging in base assentation.
if it helps them to win,
they'll lie with a grin
while pretending profuse admiration.

on the move in a war we can't win,
this long march has our strength wearing thin.
but each time we fall out,
we will soon hear sarge shout:
"time to saddle up, lads, and fall in!"

"if concupiscence means what i think,
then i've caught it,"  i said to my shrink.
"all it takes to inspire
these cold loins to catch fire
is a friendly 'hello' and a wink."

days gone by, needful guys asked for aidance,
and for digging their soil used a spadance.
(the latter's not true,
to be honest with you,
but it fits pretty well in the cadence.)

"i do." with these words, she did vow,
"dear, to you, my whole life i endow."
when he led her to bed
(legs atremble), she said,
"first things first.  the dotation, sir.  now."

mary's parents expressed consternation
when she majored in art conservation.
then they learned art was wealthy?
and old and not healthy?
and bragged of her fine education.

every arillate (ariled) plant needs
fleshy bright-colored covers for seeds.
you can eat the yew's arils.
but ackee's imperils
through dumb dietetical deeds.

oh, i love to go birding each spring,
spotting colorful birds as they sing,
but a birdwatching fall?
best vacation of all:
viewing geese, ducks, and cranes on the wing!

a penitent blackshirt from kiel
said, "the uniforms held great appeal,
so i joined the ss,
but now sadly confess
that their deeds made humanity reel."

i'm high-spirited, cheerful, enthused,
full of life, energetic, suffused
with ebullience and zest?
(all these clues! ah, you've guessed!)
of exuberance: rightly accused.

who is kind of a nut-case and daft?
whose mental department's unstaffed?
who is cuculoid? you!
like a cuckoo. me too.
my mind's open? i'm feeling a draft.

the lecherous prof, dr. beattie,
was the object of deedee's entreaty.
"i'll respond to your plea,
raise your grade to a c,"
he said, squeezing her knee. "you're a sweetie!"

during mass the presider will search
through the bible atop of his perch.
and the people should heed
all the scriptures he'll read
up in front at the ambo in church.

this device that allows me to speak?
electrolarynx? i bought mine last week.
when it's pressed on my throat,
i can start to emote;
i'm sure some day i'll talk a blue streak!

"how thick is this cardboard?" you ask,
"or the side of this wine-aging cask?"
my old ruler's no use,
but i need no excuse
'cause my caliper's fit for the task.

you're offering coffee or tea?
what the heck, if it's hot and it's free.
sure, pour me a cup
as long as you're up,
but don't make a pot just for me.

his tax burden felt like a ton,
but this filer's convinced he has won:
forms are signed and submitted
(pray nothing's omitted).
for the nonce, he has stood off the hun.

each day he gave blood, sweat and toil
as he drilled ever deep into soil.
"nature's treating me rudely,"
thought tom, gushing crudely,
"will i ever convert dirt to oil?"

bile duct cancer inside of dick's liver
made him yellow, lose weight, start to shiver,
grow taut as a banjo,
and itch.  this cholangio-
carcinoma sold dick down the river.

your attention span's short, and what's worse,
you're attracted to writing in verse.
i suppose, if you like, you
could focus on haiku
and limericks; both are quite terse.

assoilzie, if you are a scot,
means reprieve from a difficult spot.
this ancient locution
means "grant absolution."
do we miss the old word? i think not.

to chondrify means that your tissue
turns to cartilage. now, if you wish you
knew precisely the cause,
biological laws
need consulting to settle the issue.

said the prince's physician, "your highness's
brain has its pluses and minuses.
yes, it's healthy and sound,
but some bats have been found
flying round in your confluence of sinuses."

when a guy who's so shy or aloof he
keeps views to himself, it is proof he
avoids all debates,
and to argufy, hates.
seems to me, those who like to "ar gufy."

we get bhang from an indian plant
known as hemp; it's a drug. but we can't
well distinguish, if heard,
other bangs from that word:
like the noise when i blew up my aunt.

don giovanni (he's opera's don juan)
is the king of the sexual con.
although most girls are willing,
there's raping and killing;
by the end, down to hell the don's gone.

a black hawk's been downed?oh, my god!
our poor boys, so abused, used as fod-
der for feeding the hate
of the mob; bitter fate:
an atrocity's given the nod.

salt and pepper's the start of my cruet;
oil and vinegar add something to it;
lift the mustard-pot's dome,
see it brimming with loam.
in the cordon bleu final, i blew it.

you've abstracted the abstract i wrote.
you've left me distracted, don't gloat!
you've pinched my pr?cis;
return it, mais oui!
your behavior has gotten my goat.

with my braininess (use of the wits)
i reduce the whole party to fits,
for if anyone tries
to take me by surprise,
i shall brainily quip him to bits!

accumbent, the romans would dine;
relaxed, on their hips, they'd recline.
they also were found
to fiddle around,
and in that case, they could be supine.

derivations are used to explain
how those mathematicians obtain
their results so arcane
that they drive you insane,
or cause infinite pain in your brain.

the chiltepin pepper is small?
near the tiniest pepper of all
but it's got a whole lot
of what makes peppers hot;
use too much, you'll be climbing the wall!

he's known as taxonomist bill,
and the cenospecies give him a thrill.
"biological groups
swapping genomes?" he whoops,
"of this stuff i just can't get my fill!"

my dundrearies have fallen from fame,
like the lord who inspired their name
in a play long ago.
but how jolly to grow
silly sideburns and know who's to blame.

anticipation is torture, they say.
just ask waterrocks, in the u.k.
like most young adults,
she awaits the results
of her gcses, out today.

our tomatoes this year are abounding;
they're lush, red and ripe? just astounding!
we've run out of uses
(we're making excuses)
for produce that's all but dumbfounding.

a barkeeper, pee wee mcgraw,
was surprisingly quick on the draw.
so he copped a few kegs;
now he's stretching his legs
to outrun the long arm of the law.

belly dancing in egypt is seen
as offensive and wholly unclean
by some islamist minds,
so one frequently finds
foreign dancing belles now on the scene.

to be cribrated: sifted, refined,
sorted smaller from larger in kind.
there's another cribration
drives thought agitation,
thus sifting the things of the mind.

a man shearing sheep threw the bull,
even boasted of mafia pull.
then his bragging increased,
and he's turned up deceased
in the fleece. seems he's died in the wool.

the brattice: a structure you'll find
in the places where iron is mined.
when correct indications
exist, ventilation's
controlled when the planks are aligned.

she's a looker?astoundingly pretty;
jaws drop when she walks in the city.
and whenever she talks,
she's the target of gawks,
'cause she's also incredibly witty!

in my chemistry class, i've grown fond
of my partner, a pretty young blonde.
just as atoms like sharing
electrons when pairing,
we two have a covalent bond.

the compound that billy has built
is a hodgepodge, a real crazy quilt.
all the houses are scattered,
but that never mattered;
its lack of design caused no guilt.

for some months i have had the ambition
of posting a limerick submission
that in every respect
would be fully correct,
but a dull and inane composition.

while visiting kenya one day,
i saw white cattle egrets at play.
they strutted through grasses,
ate insects in masses,
and gracefully flew far away.

fagged out by the march  were my men.
we were resting and smoking, and then
pretty soon, all around us,
our foe's mortars  found us.
still buggered, we marched off again.

a u-boat mechanic named sepp
said: "my sex life was needing some pep
so i got off das boot
(it was barely afloat),
and got laid in the port of dieppe."

voluntarily simple, a nut?
i just live with essential stuff, but
my lifestyle ascetic
is good dietetic
technique for reducing my gut.

my bank account's low, i can't fudge it.
all the money i owe? i misjudge it.
i'm over my head
and i'm swimming in red.
i feel stuck with my debt and can't budge it.

an albacore (fish, not a mammal)
has a name not derived from the tamil,
the bantu or norse;
its ostensible source
is the arabic meaning "young camel."

on the etymological scene
there's a fallacy that is routine.
though it's rather absurd,
people think what a word
meant at one time, it always should mean.

hunters broke up the deer amid chatter
of venison served on a platter.
to break up means "to carve,"
so their families won't starve.
(for the deer, though, it's no laughing matter.)

i'm approached by this kid on a crutch
who has rickets and scabies and such
(so he says). food, he seeks:
"haven't eaten in weeks!"
do his problems concern me? not much.

an italian command? should you dare?
should you blare on with nary a care?
i'll remind you again; yo,
it's just a dal segno.
go back to the sign, play from there.

by attaching these bullas, i hope
that my edicts stop girls who elope
and get wed on a whim.
with that sentence, i limn
the affixment of seals by the pope.

i'm attuned, and in sync with the all;
i'm zoned and now hearing a call;
so harmoniously blissed
with the wonder, i'm kissed
by a feeling that pre-dates the fall.

i'm leery of games marked "fv."
that means fantasy violence is key
to the way the game's run.
sure, the kids think it's fun.
its effect, though, we cannot foresee.

while she's hosting, she seems thrilled to bits.
morning after, she's more like the blitz:
always biliously sniping,
and grousing and griping.
post-party post-mortems: the pits.

when attack plays an adjective's role,
its noun will have doom as its goal.
take attack force. if they
should approach you one day,
they're not out for a casual stroll.

until his small kingdom went bust,
the monarch was truly august
(that's magnificent, grand,
most revered, stately) and,
i'm afraid, not too worthy of trust.

to ground chickpeas (or gram), he adds spices
and some onion he quite finely slices.
at "a taste of the raj" he
will deep-fry each bhaji
to serve before curries and rices.

armadillos are tough little creatures:
heavy armor is one of their features.
their breath they can hold
underwater, we're told,
"and don't eat them raw," say our teachers!

when you extricate someone (remove him
from harm), you've made steps that improve him.
you have pulled the guy out
for good reason, no doubt,
so that thankful expressions behoove him.

the elliptical galaxies are
nice and smooth, lacking arms or a bar.
some are dwarfs, others giants;
they challenge our science
to figure out  features bizarre.

oranges, lemons and limes?
these are citrus fruits, good at all times.
aconitase takes
citric acid and makes
isocitric. (it's one of those zymes.)

for allhallows, the evening before,
trick-or-treaters beg sweets at my door;
then i hollow a gourd
for the saints' bed and board
and i wonder, do haloed saints snore?

her close-fitting bodices sheathe
her anatomy, making me seethe
with excitement and lust
for her bountiful bust.
man, that basque is so tight i can't breathe.

the detecter i hired to hover
in secret, in hopes to discover
if someone had part
of my wife's suspect heart,
is the guy i found out is her lover.

since you paid me my stomach feels funny,
and my poop's been increasingly runny,
and lately i've seen
that my pallor is green.
so you say it's the cholera money?

concentrated, this juice really oughta
be diluted. but if i add water,
it won't be so thick,
and the sugar won't stick,
so it won't rot the teeth of my daughter.

the word as can mean like, while, or since,
as in, "as we have run out of mints,
we'll run quick as a bunny
to get us some honey
to sip as we sample some quince."

this lace-like effect, ajour?,
gets its name from the glimpses of day-
light revealed.  it's delightful
in curtains, but frightful
in overweight hags' neglig?es.

a breatharian's mealtime fixation:
no solids or liquids. translation:
"'eating' only the air?
there's a holy life there!"
(or, more likely, he'll die of starvation.)

it was rabbit creek. when? days of yore.
but was changed to bonanza.  what for?
'cuz those panners of old
found bright nuggets of gold.
they were not up that creek without ore.

before daybreak roy's up in the stand
with an ar-15 (though it's banned).
he must bag something cervine
to take back to irvine.
he'd bragged he'd have deer in each hand.

"giant yard sale, turn right" the sign read.
she veered and pressed on as it said.
if the detours were clipped,
all these side trips were skipped,
we'd have more time for nookie instead.

rachel carson used stark terminology
when propounding her views on ecology.
silent spring is her book
that compelled us to look
at how pesticides harm earth's biology.

in our youth, we were cherry bomb flingers.
how the memory of gunpowder lingers!
now they're gone. we've been cursed
by two words: "safety first!"
we've grown far too attached to our fingers!

when your graphics are meant to be seen
having colors, authentic and clean,
well, you won't leave 'em squinting
with additive printing?
primarily blue, red and green.

devitrification is when
glass loses its luster, and then
you just can't see through it;
whatever you do, it
will not be transparent again.

look, i know you feel mortified. fine!
but you drank all my fortified wine:
the marsala, the sherry?
what made you most merry?
the tawny, you portified swine!

my biology teacher advises
anisogamy's sex that comprises
reproduction by fusion
(it's not an illusion)
of gametes of different sizes.

fresh from footloose, the star kevin bacon
threw me out of my chair. i was shaken!
with no effort to greet me,
he'd moved to disseat me.
"dis seat," he informed me, "is taken!"

the word able can mean "good at learning."
able children are frequently yearning
to pass every test
and be seen as the best
as respect from their teachers they're earning.

when pests make their nests in your house,
and intimidate you and your spouse,
the exterminator tries,
with his toxic supplies,
to destroy every cockroach and mouse.
